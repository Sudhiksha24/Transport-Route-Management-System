TRANSPORT ROUTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
 Project Overview

The **Transport Route Management System** is a Java-based web application developed using Servlets, JSP, and JDBC. The system is designed to manage and maintain transport route information efficiently through a structured, database-driven approach.

This application allows administrators to:

* Add new transport routes
* View details of a specific route
* Display all available routes

Each route record is stored in an Oracle Database and includes details such as Route ID, Route Code, Route Name, Start Location, End Location, Distance (in kilometers), and Remarks. A unique Route ID is automatically generated using an Oracle sequence to ensure data consistency and integrity.

The project follows a layered architecture consisting of:

* Presentation Layer (JSP, HTML, Servlets)
* Service Layer (Business logic handling)
* DAO Layer (Database interaction using JDBC)
* Utility Layer (Database connection management)

This system demonstrates practical implementation of:

* MVC architecture
* JDBC connectivity with Oracle
* PreparedStatement for secure SQL execution
* Input validation and exception handling
* Database sequence integration

The application is deployed on Apache Tomcat and serves as a foundational enterprise-style Java web application suitable for academic and learning purposes.
